This repository holds my Go files from the [Programming is for Lovers Course](http://compeau.cbd.cmu.edu/online-education/programming-for-lovers-a-manifesto/) by Phillip Compeau

**Spoiler Alert** There are solutions to the exercises here. If you are taking the course, don't look at them until you have taken a crack at the problem!
